# baseball-stats
Scripts to import baseball statistics into MATLAB. You can use these to do statistical analysis on baseball performance.

## Use
Run ```process_data``` to import the data into MATLAB tables. 

You can plot interesting data like so
![Phillies wOBA Plot 2004-2014](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gehrhorn/baseball-stats/master/images/Phillies%20wOBA.png)

or like so

![Doubles over time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gehrhorn/baseball-stats/master/images/doublesovertime.png)

or like so

![Max hits vs. max doubles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gehrhorn/baseball-stats/master/images/maxhitsvsmaxdoubles.png)

I offer thanks to Sean. Sports statistics are sometimes hard to come by and this is a good resource for baseball and stats geeks alike.

## Note
I work for MathWorks and we make MATLAB. Zero part of my job is selling MATLAB. I made this because I wanted to play with baseball stats, not to promote MATLAB.
